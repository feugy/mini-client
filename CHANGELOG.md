# Changelog

## 4.2.0
#### Added
- Support for Buffer and Stream parameters and results
- Transports for a better extensibility, and the corresponding `getClient()`'s `transport.type` option (default to `local` transport)
- `init()` method is now optional: initialization will occur at first call if needed, whatever transport used
- Usage of Yarn 

#### Fixed
- `client.exposed` contains the exposed descriptor, even with local transport (only http transport used to have one) 
- Http errors are now wrapped in Boom errors with http transport (only local transport was propagating them)

#### Changed
- `getClient()` always throws synchronous validation errors.
- When called, `init()` always refresh the exposed APIs. 
  This allows to force initialization proactively when suspecting a remote service change.

  Previously it was feching exposed APIs only once.
- Use [got](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got) instead of [request-promise-native](https://github.com/request/request-promise-native). 

  Thrown Error codes and message may be slighlty different.
- Reformat CHANGELOG to follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) recommandations
- New documentation with latest docma v2.0.0
- Dependencies update

#### Deprecated
- `getClient()`'s `remote` option: replace with `transport.uri` option.
- `getClient()`'s `timeout` option: replace with `transport.timeout` option.
