<p>Mini-client is a generic client for µServices built with <a href="https://github.com/feugy/mini-service">mini-service</a>.
The goal of mini-service is to give the minimal structure to implement a µService, that can be invoked locally or remotely.</p>
<p>Its principles are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>very easy to add new service api endpoints</li>
<li>easy to use client interface, same usage both locally and remotely</li>
<li>hide deployment details and provide simple-yet-working solution</li>
<li>promises based</li>
</ul>
<p>mini-client &amp; mini-service use the latest ES6 features, so they requires node 6+</p>
<p>Please checkout the <a href="https://feugy.github.io/mini-client/">API reference</a></p>

<h2 id="generic-client-for-mini-services">Generic client for mini-services</h2>
<hr />
<p>Mini-client expose a generic client that can be wired to any service exposed with <a href="https://github.com/feugy/mini-service">mini-service</a>.
It provides an JavaScript object, that will fetch exposed APIs and creates a function for each of them.
This allow to invoke remote API like if they were plain function (it's a kind of good old RPC).</p>
<p><code>caller-remote.js</code></p>
<pre><code class="javascript">const getClient = require('mini-client')

const calc = getClient({
  remote: 'http://localhost:3000'
})
calc.add(10, 5).then(sum =&gt; console.log(`Result is: ${sum}`))</code></pre>
<p>Each API will end-up as a function (named after the API itself) that returns a promise.
Calling a function that isn't an exposed API will fails as if you try to invoked an unknown property of a regular
 object.</p>
<p>At the first call, mini-client fetch from the remote server the exposed API and creates the actual functions.</p>
<p>After being initialized, a mini-client can't be wired to another service, and will always try to invoke the one it
was initiliazed with.</p>
<p>Please note that you can call <code>init()</code> (see bellow), which doesn't do anything in "remote mode".</p>
<h2 id="generic-client-for-local-services">Generic client for local services</h2>
<hr />
<p>While calling remote service is a realistic scenario for production environments, it's more convenient to run
all code in the same unit on dev (for debugging) and in continuous integration.</p>
<p>That's why mini-client can run the in "local mode".
In this case, the service definition is loaded at initialization.</p>
<p><code>caller-local.js</code></p>
<pre><code class="javascript">const getClient = require('mini-client')
const calcService = require('./calc-service')

const calc = getClient(calcService)
calc.init().then(() =&gt;
  calc.add(10, 5).then(sum =&gt; console.log(`Result is: ${sum}`))
)</code></pre>
<p>Two noticeable difference with "remote mode":</p>
<ul>
<li>you need to provide the <a href="https://github.com/feugy/mini-service?api#server:startServer">service definition</a> when creating the client</li>
<li>you need to invoke <code>init()</code> prior to any call, which run exposed API initialization code
(as if the server were starting)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, you can invoke exposed APIs as function like in "remote mode".</p>
<h2 id="validations">Validations</h2>
<hr />
<p>When invoking an exposed API, Mini-client can report parameters validation error.
If the distant service denies the operation because of a missing or errored parameter,
the returned promise will be rejected with the appropriate error message.</p>
<h2 id="checksum-compatibility-and-automatic-reloads">Checksum compatibility and automatic reloads</h2>
<hr />
<p>When Mini-client is running in remote mode, it caches remote exposed API at first call.
But what would happened if a new version of remote server is redeployed ?</p>
<p>If the list of newer exposed API equals the one used when Mini-client was started, everything will be fine.
But if the two lists are different, then there's a chance that Mini-client will invoke URLs that don't exist any more, or requires different parameters.</p>
<p>To detect such changes, the CRC-32 checksum of the exposed Api list is sent by remote server in the <code>X-Service-CRC</code> response header.
On each call, Mini-client will compare that checksum with the one valid when it initialized.</p>
<p>If both value differs, then Mini-Client will:</p>
<ul>
<li>mark all existing functions as deprecated (they will reject further call with appropriate error)<blockquote>
<p>Remote server isn't compatible with current client (expects <a href="mailto:service-name@x.y.z">service-name@x.y.z</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>fetch new list of exposed APIs on remote server, and creates/updates function</li>
<li>invoke the current function to process with call (will succeed if supported)</li>
</ul>
<p>When Mini-client is running on local mode, such situation can never happen.</p>

<h2 id="3x-to-4x-migration">3.x to 4.x migration</h2>
<hr />
<p>None: v4 is using async/await, which requires node@8+. Code is fully backward compatible.</p>
<h2 id="2x-to-3x-migration">2.x to 3.x migration</h2>

<p>Groups are now used as sub-objects of mini-client.</p>
<p>Given a service exposing:</p>
<ul>
<li>api <code>ping</code> without group <em>(or if group has same name as overall service)</em></li>
<li>group <code>a</code> with apis <code>ping</code> &amp; <code>pong</code></li>
<li>group <code>b</code> with api <code>ping</code></li>
</ul>
<p>the final Mini-client will be:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">client = {
  ping(),
  a: {
    ping(),
    pong()
  },
  b: {
    ping()
  }
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="1x-to-2x-migration">1.x to 2.x migration</h2>
<hr />
<p>Local services, as remote services, <strong>must</strong> have <code>name</code> and <code>version</code> options defined</p>
<p>When loading services, the <code>services</code> property was renamed to <code>groups</code>, and <code>serviceOpts</code> is now <code>groupOpts</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">const {startServer} = require('mini-service')

startServer({
  groups: [ // was services previously
    require('../serviceA'),
    require('../serviceB'),
    require('../serviceC')
  ],
  groupOpts: { // was serviceOpts previously
    serviceA: {},
    serviceB: {},
    serviceC: {}
  }
})</code></pre>
